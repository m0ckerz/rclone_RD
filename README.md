### EVENTHOUGH REALDEBRID NOW SUPPORTS WEBDAV, I STILL RECOMMEND USING THIS FORK

Realdebrid has added support for the WebDav protocoll, which makes it mountable through official rclone software.
As of now (19.08) realdebrids webdav implementation does not support torrent file deletion through rclone and limits the amount of torrents displayed to 200. Its also a whole lot slower than my fork. That is because each time a file is accessed through the webdav server, realdebrid only checks the first 1000 direct links from /downloads. If no corresponding direct link is found, which is most likely the case if you have more than 1000 files, the realdebrid webdav will unrestricts the file again. If you refresh your plex library of the mounted drive for example (and you have a library of more than 1000 files), every single file is unrestricted again and again, which takes a very long time. plex will also re-detect intros and do other metadata task every time a file is unrestricted again.

They did mention that torrent file deletion works with other webdav mounting programs, but I recommend using my fork instead of the realdebrid webdav.

# RClone_RD

This RClone Fork contains a Real-Debrid implementation.
Using this version, the entire RealDebrid /torrents directory can be served as a read-only virtual drive. 

A potential use-case for this is serving the /torrent directory over plex, allowing you to build a media library truly unlimted in size. Im working on a project that allows plex to function the same way that Wako,Syncler and other streaming apps do. Check it out on https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_rd

### Capabilities and Limitations:

- Read/Write capabilities are limited to reading files and deleting them. 
- This rclone fork will automatically sort your torrents into 3 subfolder: "shows", "movies" and "default". If a torrent couldnt be classified as a movie or a show, you can find it in the "default" folder.
- There are no server-side traffic or storage limitations.
- This rclone fork will automatically re-activate direct links when they expire after 1 week.
- There is a server-side connection limit, which I believe is 16 parallel connections.

## Installation:

### Windows:

- install winfsp (https://winfsp.dev/)
- download the latest pre-built 'rclone.exe' file from here: https://github.com/itsToggle/rclone_RD/releases

### Mac OSX (community build):

- I can't cross-compile for macOS, so I'm relying on you guys to compile and share the macOS releases :)
- download the latest pre-built 'rclone-darwin' file from here: https://github.com/itsToggle/rclone_RD/releases

### Linux:

- download the latest pre-built 'rclone-linux' file from here: https://github.com/itsToggle/rclone_RD/releases

### Android:
This version is based the latest release from the [rcx github](https://github.com/x0b/rcx). Ive simply replaced the 'librclone.so' file inside the apk with a compiled version of my rclone fork. To be able to install the apk, the app needed to be signed again which i have done with an [apk-signer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haibison.apksigner&hl=en&gl=US) from the android playstore, which Im pretty sure isnt malicious. 
To add realdebrid as a remote, simply setup a realdebrid remote on your PC and copy the `rclone.conf` file (`C:\Users\BigSchlong\.config\rclone`) to your android device. Inside the RCX App you can now load your rclone config file. Youre done, you can mount realdebrid on your android device :)

- download the latest pre-built 'apk' file from here: https://github.com/itsToggle/rclone_RD/releases

## Setting up the remote:

0. open a terminal in the download location of your rclone_rd file.
1. configure rclone by running the command 'rclone config' (could be './rclone config' and depending on your os, the filename could be './rclone-linux' or similar. If you get a permission denied error (linux & macos), run 'sudo chmod u+x rclone-linux', adjusted to the filename.)
2. create a new remote by typing 'n'
3. give your remote a name (e.g. 'your-remote')
4. choose '47) realdebrid' as your remote type
5. follow the rest of the prompted instructions, choose 'no advaced configuration'
6. You can mount your newly created remote by running the command 'rclone cmount your-remote: X: --dir-cache-time 10s' (replace 'your-remote' with your remote name, replace 'X' with a drive letter of your choice or replace 'X:' with a destination folder)
7. If you are running my rclone fork on Linux, replace "cmount" with "mount" in the command above.
8. You've successfuly created a virtual drive of your debrid service!

**You can run rclone as a background service by adding the mounting tag '--no-console' (Windows) or '--deamon' (Linux, Mac, etc).**

### Recommended Tags when mounting:

It is recommended to use the tags in this example mounting command: 

'rclone mount torrents: Y: --dir-cache-time 10s'

This will significantly speed up the mounted drive and detect changes faster.

## Building it yourself (Windows)

I really do suggest downloading the pre-built release. But if you want to tinker a bit and built it yourself, here are the steps:
- Download the project files. 
- Install Golang
- To build the project, you need to have MinGW or a different cgo adaptation installed.
- install WinFsp.
- If you dont want to mount the remote as a virtual drive but rather as a dlna server or silimar, use 'go build' to build the project.
- If you do want to mount the remote as a virtual drive, continue:
- Build the project using 'go build -tags cmount'. 
- if that fails on 'fatal error: fuse_common.h missing', you need to do the following steps:
- Locate this folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp\inc\fuse - inside you will find the missing files.
- Copy all files to the directory that they are missing from. For me that was: C:\Users\BigSchlong\go\pkg\mod\github.com\winfsp\cgofuse@v1.5.1-0.20220421173602-ce7e5a65cac7\fuse
- Try to build it again

## Building it yourself (Mac/Linux)

- Download the project files
- Install Golang 
- Run a terminal in the root directory of the project files
- use 'go build -tags cmount' to build the project
- If anything fails, Check the official rclone Channels for Help.
- Please feel free to contact me if you have compiled a version, so I can provide it as a comunity build for others :)
